The "o"s are the player, you move him with the arrow keys and he continues moving until he hits an object.

The solid blocks are walls, they stop your progress.

The blocks with a "G" are the goal, you must reach this blockc to finish the level.

The half-filled in blocks are unlockable.

The small squares are the keys to unlock the unlockable blocks. These do not impede progress.

The blocks with a "T" are teleporter blocks. When you hit one from one side, you come out going the same direction from the matching teleporter block.
